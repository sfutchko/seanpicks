# SEAN PICKS - REAL DATA SOURCES (NO MOCK/ESTIMATES)

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING WITH REAL DATA

### 1. **The Odds API** (YOUR KEY: d4fa91883b15fd5a5594c64e58b884ef)
- ‚úÖ Real-time betting lines from 8+ sportsbooks
- ‚úÖ Sharp vs Square book detection (comparing Pinnacle vs DraftKings lines)
- ‚úÖ Line movement tracking (by comparing books)
- ‚úÖ Best available lines across all books
- **This is REAL DATA - not estimated**

### 2. **OpenWeatherMap API** (YOUR KEY: 85203d1084a3bc89e21a0409e5b9418b)
- ‚úÖ Real weather data for all outdoor stadiums
- ‚úÖ Temperature, wind speed, precipitation
- ‚úÖ Dome detection for indoor stadiums
- **This is REAL DATA - working perfectly**

### 3. **Sharp Money Detection** (FROM ODDS API)
- ‚úÖ Comparing sharp books (Pinnacle, Bookmaker) vs square books (DraftKings, FanDuel)
- ‚úÖ When sharp books have different lines than square books = sharp money
- ‚úÖ Line variance of 0.5+ points = sharp action detected
- **This is REAL DATA - calculated from actual sportsbook lines**

3. **Line Value (WORKING)**: The Odds API shows best lines across all books
4. **Injuries (MANUAL)**: Check NFL.com before games and enter via manual interface
5. **Public Betting (MANUAL)**: Check Action Network/Covers and enter via manual interface

## üìä CONFIDENCE CALCULATION WITH REAL DATA ONLY

Base: 50%
+ Sharp money detected (from Odds API): +3-5% ‚úÖ
+ Weather impact (from OpenWeatherMap): +1-2% ‚úÖ
+ Line value (from Odds API): +1% per 0.5 points ‚úÖ
+ Key numbers crossed: +2% ‚úÖ
+ Situational spots: +1-2% ‚úÖ
+ Injuries (when manually entered): +1-4% ‚ö†Ô∏è
+ Public fade (when manually entered): +2% ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current achievable confidence with automated data: 55-62%**
**With manual injury/public data entry: 58-68%**

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

### Before Each Game Day:
1. Check NFL.com for injury reports (5 minutes)
2. Check Action Network for public betting % (5 minutes)
3. Run the data entry script:
   ```bash
   cd backend/app/services
   python enter_data.py
   ```
4. Enter the real injury and public betting data
5. Your algorithm will now use REAL DATA ONLY

### Automated Data (No Action Needed):
- Sharp money indicators ‚úÖ
- Weather data ‚úÖ
- Line shopping/best lines ‚úÖ
