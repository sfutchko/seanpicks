## 🚨 ALGORITHM DIFFERENCES

### Current (Too Simple):
```python
confidence = 0.50
if sharp_action: confidence += 0.03
if RLM: confidence += 0.03
if steam: confidence += 0.04
```

### Original (Complex):
```python
# Combines 4 models
pattern_confidence = apply_patterns(game)
analytical_confidence = analytical_model(game)
situational_confidence = situational_analysis(game)
market_confidence = market_analysis(game)

final = weighted_average(all_confidences)
```

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

1. **Connect Weather API** ✅ (Have key: 85203d1084a3bc89e21a0409e5b9418b)
2. **Run Injury Scraper**
3. **Connect Public Betting Data**
4. **Import Full Prediction Engine**
5. **Add Live Betting Module**
6. **Connect Reddit/YouTube Scrapers**

## DATA WE'RE NOT USING
- Historical patterns database
- Referee tendencies
- Team pace/style matchups
- Home/road splits
- Weather correlations
- Injury impact models
