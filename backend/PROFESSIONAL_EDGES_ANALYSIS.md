# Professional Betting Edges Analysis
## What We Have vs What Pros Use

### ‚úÖ WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE

1. **Basic Sharp Indicators**
   - Line movement detection
   - Reverse line movement
   - Steam move detection
   - Public fade opportunities

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Team stats (batting, pitching, bullpen)
   - Pitcher matchups
   - Recent form (last 3 starts)
   - Park factors
   - Weather impact

3. **Odds Comparison**
   - Multiple sportsbooks (DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM)
   - Best line identification
   - Basic arbitrage spotting

4. **Live Betting**
   - In-game status tracking
   - Quarter/inning estimation
   - Live odds updates

### üî¥ CRITICAL MISSING EDGES PROS USE

#### 1. **CLOSING LINE VALUE (CLV) - MOST IMPORTANT**
```python
# Pros track if they beat the closing line consistently
# This is the #1 indicator of long-term success
- Track opening line vs our bet vs closing line
- Historical CLV percentage (should be >52% for profit)
- Line freeze detection (books afraid to move)
```

#### 2. **TRUE MARKET PERCENTAGES**
```python
# We simulate this, but pros pay for real data:
- Actual public betting % (tickets)
- Actual money % (handle) 
- Sharp vs square money split
- Liability exposure by book
# Services: Sports Insights, Action Network, BetLabs
```

#### 3. **PLAYER PROPS & DERIVATIVES**
```python
# Where the real edge is nowadays:
- Player prop modeling (huge inefficiencies)
- Same game parlay correlations
- First half/quarter markets
- Team totals vs game totals
- Alt lines expected value
```

#### 4. **ADVANCED LINE SHOPPING**
```python
# Not just best line, but:
- Pinnacle/Circa origination tracking
- Sharp book vs square book divergence
- Reduced juice opportunities (-105 vs -110)
- Bonus/promo exploitation
- Middle/scalp opportunities in real-time
```

#### 5. **SITUATIONAL DATABASE**
```python
# Historical patterns pros exploit:
- Revenge games (lost by 20+ last meeting)
- Sandwich games (big game before/after)
- Lookahead spots (big game next week)
- Travel fatigue (West->East, B2B road)
- Referee/umpire tendencies & totals
- Day game after night game
```

#### 6. **INJURY IMPACT MODELING**
```python
# Not just "player out" but:
- VORP (Value Over Replacement)
- Minutes/snap count distribution
- Backup quality assessment
- Late scratch monitoring
- Questionable -> Active conversion rates
```

#### 7. **IN-GAME MODELING**
```python
# Live betting sophistication:
- Win probability models by situation
- Expected points/runs by game state
- Momentum quantification
- Coaching tendency database
- Timeout/challenge impact
```

#### 8. **WEATHER DERIVATIVES**
```python
# More sophisticated than current:
- Wind direction by stadium orientation
- Humidity impact on ball flight
- Historical weather vs totals
- Precipitation probability changes
```

### üí∞ ADVANCED TOOLS PROS USE

#### 1. **Bet Tracking & Analysis**
- Actual vs expected results
- ROI by bet type, sport, time
- Regression analysis
- Monte Carlo simulations

#### 2. **Bankroll Optimization**
- Kelly Criterion sizing
- Risk of ruin calculations
- Correlation risk (parlays)
- Sport allocation optimization

#### 3. **Market Making**
- Create own lines before books
- Identify stale lines
- No-vig probability calculation
- Market width analysis

#### 4. **API Automation**
- Auto-bet on value (beat closing)
- Steam chase automation
- Arbitrage execution
- Line freeze alerts

### üéØ MOST IMPACTFUL TO ADD (RANKED)

1. **Closing Line Value Tracking** (Easiest, highest impact)
   - Store our pick line vs closing line
   - Show CLV % over time
   - Alert when we consistently beat close

2. **Player Props Module** (Huge inefficiencies)
   - Focus on: Points, Rebounds, Assists (NBA)
   - Passing yards, TDs (NFL)  
   - Hits, Runs, RBIs (MLB)

3. **True Betting Percentages** (Costs ~$99/month from Action Network API)
   - Real public vs sharp money
   - Liability by book
   - Historical profitability by situation

4. **Situational Angles Database**
   - Build historical trends
   - Quantify impact
   - Auto-flag games matching criteria

5. **Advanced Line Shopping**
   - Add more books (Circa, Pinnacle, BetRivers)
   - Reduced juice tracking
   - Middle opportunity alerts

### üí° QUICK WINS WE COULD ADD NOW

1. **No-Vig Lines** - Calculate true probability
```python
def remove_vig(odds1, odds2):
    # Remove juice to find true probability
    prob1 = implied_probability(odds1)
    prob2 = implied_probability(odds2)
    total = prob1 + prob2
    return prob1 / total, prob2 / total
```

2. **Expected Value Display**
```python
def calculate_ev(our_prob, line_odds):
    # Show $ EV for each bet
    decimal_odds = american_to_decimal(line_odds)
    ev = (our_prob * decimal_odds) - 1
    return ev * 100  # As percentage
```

3. **Correlated Parlay Detection**
```python
# Flag correlated outcomes:
- Game over + team over
- Player over points + team win
- First half over + game over
```

4. **Unit Sizing Recommendation**
```python
# Kelly Criterion implementation:
def kelly_criterion(win_prob, odds):
    q = 1 - win_prob
    b = decimal_odds - 1
    kelly = (b * win_prob - q) / b
    return min(kelly * 0.25, 0.05)  # Quarter Kelly, max 5%
```

### üöÄ NEXT LEVEL FEATURES

1. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Neural networks for game prediction
   - Player performance clustering
   - Situation pattern recognition

2. **Automated Betting**
   - API integration with sportsbooks
   - Auto-bet on value threshold
   - Steam chase automation

3. **Backtesting Engine**
   - Test strategies on historical data
   - Optimize parameters
   - Out-of-sample validation

4. **Social/Copy Trading**
   - Follow sharp bettors
   - Aggregate picks from multiple sources
   - Consensus vs contrarian plays

### üìä WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS MOST

Based on professional betting syndicates:

1. **CLV is KING** - If you beat closing line by 3%+, you WILL profit
2. **Volume at small edges** > Few bets at big edges  
3. **Props & derivatives** - Less efficient than main markets
4. **Origination tracking** - Pinnacle/Circa move first
5. **Correlation exploitation** - SGPs with hidden value

### üéÆ COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES WE HAVE

1. **Real-time data aggregation** - Faster than manual
2. **Systematic approach** - No emotional betting
3. **Multi-sport coverage** - Diversification
4. **Free to use** - No subscription costs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è LEGAL/ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

- Arbitrage might get accounts limited
- Steam chasing needs speed (sub-second)
- Some books ban winners
- Multiple accounts gray area
- Bonus exploitation can = ban
